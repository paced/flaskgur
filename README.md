## flaskgur

Simple image hosting site written with Flask and Python. Forked from chokepoint's flask app, this is an even lighter version that hashes filenames differently and provides a simpler image upload feature. It is meant for use by apps like ShareX or using tools like `maim` and `slop` using POST requests.
